    <h2>A New Era</h2>
    <img src="images/new_era.webp" alt="Digital cinema" class="logo">
    <p>
        Digital cinema has changed filmmaking and exhibition, offering way more flexibility when filming and showing films,
        immediate playback, and scalability. From the early days of SD video to today's
        ultra-high-resolution formats, digital technology has allowed filmmakers to experiment with new
        styles, workflows and storytelling techniques. But this has come at a price.

    <h2>Early Video/SD Cameras</h2>

    </a>
    <p>
        Early video cameras captured images in standard definition (SD), usually 480i or 576i resolution.
        While limited in color depth and sharpness, SD cameras were widely used in television, low-budget
        productions, and Independent films. Their small file sizes and ease of use made them a stepping stone
        to higher-quality digital formats and a more accesible start to filmmaking. big exponents of this format are David Lynch's Inland Empire and Danny Boyle's 28 days later

    <h2>High Definition (HD) Cameras</h2>
    <a href="https://youtu.be/AG7twMj86PE?si=13eYTrFHq5_Ojx2V">
        <img src="images/HDex.jpg" alt="High Definition video example" class="example">
    </a>
    <p>
        HD cameras brought a significant improvement in resolution (typically 720p or 1080p) and color fidelity.
        Filmmakers embraced HD for television, documentaries, and indie productions. HD offered sharper images
        and greater detail than SD, while remaining cost-effective for productions transitioning from analog to
        digital workflows. a film shot on HD is Miami Vice from 2006, another example can be Sean Baker's Tangerine that was shot on an iphone 6.

    <h2>4K Cameras</h2>
    <a href="https://youtu.be/959rTZ4fnk4?si=iGfVqyakJ0angGff">
        <img src="images/4Kex.jpg" alt="4K video example" class="example">
    </a>
    <p>
        4K digital cameras, capturing 3840×2160 or 4096×2160 pixels, became the new standard for theatrical
        releases and high-end streaming. 4K offers enhanced detail, dynamic range, and post-production flexibility,
        including cropping, stabilization, and visual effects. Many modern films are shot or mastered in 4K. 
        A very good example of 4k cinematography can be Daniel Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049.

<section id="UltraHD">
    <h2>Ultra High Definition (8.5K+ Cameras)</h2>
    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bn_-YoG69Sw">
        <img src="images/8kex.jpg" alt="Ultra High Definition video example" class="example">
    </a>
    <p>
        Ultra High Definition cameras, often exceeding 8K resolution, provide extraordinary clarity, detail, and
        color precision. Used in IMAX productions, virtual reality, and large-scale visual effects work,
        these formats push the boundaries of image quality. Ultra HD cameras allow filmmakers to build
        their projects for next-generation displays and cinematic experiences. In the lists of films shot on 8-8.6k are All Quiet On The Western Front(2023) and Portrait Of A Lady On Fire.
