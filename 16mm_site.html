    <p>
        Ultra 16mm is a variation of standard 16mm with a wider image area achieved by reducing the space of the perforations.
        This allows for a wider aspect ratio (commonly 1.85:1) without using anamorphic lenses, giving filmmakers a more cinematic
        look while maintaining the low cost of 16mm. Cinematographer Frank G. DeMarco is credited with inventing Ultra 16 in 1996 while shooting tests for Darren Aronofsky's Pi.
