        <img src="images/intro.webp" alt="Film" class="logo">
        <p>Created on 1932, 8mm is a motion picture film format in which the film strip is eight millimetres. It was developed by the Eastman Kodak company during the Great Depression and released to the market in 1932 to create a home movie format that was less expensive than 16 mm. since then it became an affordable and easy-to-use alternative that became widely available to the general public. The demand for the user-friendly, popular film format exploded, and suddenly, every family had an amateur filmmaker-in-training. In 1965, Super-8 film was released and was quickly adopted by many amateur film-makers. It featured a better quality image and was easier to use mainly due to a cartridge-loading system that did not require reloading and rethreading halfway through.</p>

        <h2>Style and Characteristics</h2>
        <img src="images/estilo.jpeg" alt="8mm film example" class="example1">
        <p>  8mm and Super 8 film are instantly recognizable for their distinct visual qualities(or defects). The small frame size results in very pronounced grain, softer detail,
  and a textured image that emphasizes motion over sharpness. Exposure can
  be inconsistent, producing flicker and visible light fluctuations that
  in the process, generate a nostalgic aesthetic</p>

  Besides home movies, 8mm film became an important tool for experimental
  and avant-garde filmmakers. Its low cost and small size allowed artists
  to work outside the commercial film industry and explore more curious and uncommon sides of filmmaking, an example can be <strong>Hollis Frampton</strong> and his various avant-garde short films shot on 8mm and super8, like the clickable picture above from his 1969 short film "lemon"

        <h2>Super 8 film and filmmaking</h2>

         Super 8 was introduced by Kodak in 1965 as an improved successor to 8mm film. 
By enlarging the image area and repositioning the perforations, Super 8 was able to 
capture a noticeably better, sharper and cleaner image with finer grain and better color reproduction. 
The format was also easier to load thanks to its cartridge system, making filming more 
accessible to artists and amateurs.  

The short film "Halcyon" is an example of the characteristic Super 8 look: smoother motion, richer colors,
and improved detail when compared to earlier 8mm footage, while it still dont reaches industry standards it was a way better option for small filmmakers of the time.
